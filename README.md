# Visual-Food-Quality-Inspection
The goal of this project is to extract data from different sources by using different techniques, Cleaned that data thoroughly and use to trained model to predict  whether the fruits and vegetables are edible or contaminated The prediction which is given by  our system will give the user the quite insight of the quality of fruits and vegetables. Whether it is ready to eat or not.   The increased awareness and difficulty of consumers have created the expectation for  improved quality in consumer food products. Quality has been the subject of a large  number of studies. The basis of quality assessment is often subjective with attributes such as appearance, smell, texture, and flavor, frequently examined by human inspectors.
