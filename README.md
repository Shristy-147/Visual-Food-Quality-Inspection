Whether it is ready to eat or not.   The increased awareness and difficulty of consumers have created the expectation for  improved quality in consumer food products. Quality has been the subject of a large  number of studies. The basis of quality assessment is often subjective with attributes such as appearance, smell, texture, and flavor, frequently examined by human inspectors.
